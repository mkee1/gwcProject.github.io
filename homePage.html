  <p>
    ExtraOrdinary was designed to advocate, support, and provide resources for people with special needs in communities across the country. We also aim to combat the common false stereotypes and assumptions about people with disabilities and encourage peer interaction. In schools all across America, there are roughly 6.7 million students receiving special needs education. And according to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 1 in 5 Americans have a disability. Together, letâ€™s be ambassadors and friends for all members of our community!

  <h3>Aleena Rehman: </h3>

      I joined this project because I want to be an agent of equity and inclusiveness. For me, computer science is a tool to balance inequalities and provide resources for those often neglected by the societal norm--and coming from an immigrant family, I've unfortunately see the crippling divide between different cultures, religions, and values. The reality is the world can be very apathetic to those who don't follow what's perceived as normal, and the stereotypes surrounding people with special needs can be damaging. By raising awareness through code, I hope to give tools to those with special needs so they can do awesome things (because they most definitely can).
    </ul>

  <h3>Elisa Jacobo: </h3>
    <ul>
      When we had to choose a project to do for GWC, I had no idea what to do. I saw special needs and thought back to my Keyboarding class. The boy that sat next to me had autism. He asked for help when the teacher went too fast and always asked me about my day. Other kids made references he didn't understand then laugh at him. Even though the other kids made fun of him, the boy still asked them how they were and told them about his day. I chose this project to teach people that people with special needs and disabilities should be treated equally. I know that I don't want anyone to be treated the same way as the boy in my Keyboarding class.
