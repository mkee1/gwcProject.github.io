    <h3> Our Message: </h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    ExtraOrdinary was designed to advocate, support, and provide resources for people with special needs in communities across the country. We also aim to combat the common false stereotypes and assumptions about people with disabilities and encourage peer interaction. In schools all across America, there are roughly 6.7 million students receiving special needs education. And according to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 1 in 5 Americans have a disability. Together, let’s be ambassadors and friends for all members of our community!

      I joined this project because I want to be an agent of equity and inclusiveness. For me, computer science is a tool to balance inequalities and provide resources for those often neglected by the societal norm--and coming from an immigrant family, I've unfortunately see the crippling divide between different cultures, religions, and values. The reality is the world can be very apathetic to those who don't follow what's perceived as normal, and the stereotypes surrounding people with special needs can be damaging. By raising awareness through code, I hope to give tools to those with special needs so they can do awesome things (because they most definitely can).

  <h3>Elisa Jacobo: </h3>

      When we had to choose a project to do for GWC, I had no idea what to do. I saw special needs and thought back to my Keyboarding class. The boy that sat next to me had autism. He asked for help when the teacher went too fast and always asked me about my day. Other kids made references he didn't understand then laugh at him. Even though the other kids made fun of him, the boy still asked them how they were and told them about his day. I chose this project to teach people that people with special needs and disabilities should be treated equally. I know that I don't want anyone to be treated the same way as the boy in my Keyboarding class.

      This project is very meaningful to me because my oldest sister has special needs. Often, I have encountered people being uncomfortable around her or unintentionally assume something about her special needs due to a lack of knowledge. Some may say it must be so difficult for my family to care for my sister. I’d like them to know that while it may be hard at times, it’s normal for my family. I believe having my sister with special needs has actually enriched my character and personality. Thanks to Girls Who Code, I've learned how to code and build a website. This is an exciting, new way for me to inform and help others realize that people with special needs truly are beautiful. The one take-away I want users to have after viewing our website is to strive to “see the person beyond the disability.”

  <h3>Bobo Tam: </h3>

      Looking at a list of ideas for my final project in Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, none hold my attention but one, creating something dedicated to help people with special needs. Whenever I encounter people with special needs, they would always greet me with the brightest smile on their face and that would make my day a lot better. With the skills I learned in this summer program, I wanted do something for them. By creating a website with information of mental illness, I hope to enhance the community's knowledge, including mine, of mental illness. I don't want anyone to be uncomfortable around people with special needs because they're not familar with what people with special.
