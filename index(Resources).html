      <h2>How should I interact with people that have special needs?</h2>
      <ul> People with special needs are people too! Like anyone, they have real feelings, so we should follow the appropriate terminology when talking about or talking to somenone with special needs. There are many false stereotypes and incorrect assumptions about people with special needs. The best advice when interacting with someone with special needs is to get to know the person based on their personality rather than their disability.
